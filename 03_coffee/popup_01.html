        <h3>Our Favourite<br/>Iced Coffee Recipe</h3>
        <p>We’ve always had iced filter coffee on the menu at Market Lane, and we absolutely love it! We love the strong, fresh and dairy-free flavour – there’s nothing we crave more on a hot summer day.</p>

      <h4>Our favourite way to prepare an iced filter is -</h4>
      <p>A technique known as “Japanese-style iced pour over”, or “iced pour over”. It is made by brewing a strong pour over directly onto ice. By brewing the hot coffee straight onto ice, it cools the brew down and dilutes it at the same time, creating a delicious, cold filter coffee. Is your mouth watering yet?!</p>
      <p>A lot of people know cold filter coffee by the name “cold brew”, which is a popular way of brewing cold coffee, especially in the USA. Cold Brew is prepared in the way the name suggests – a high ratio of coffee is steeped in cold water over a long period of time, sometimes for 24 hours or more. The coffee is then filtered and stored in the fridge before being served. Cold Brew is popular because it allows cafes to brew large amounts of coffee days in advance of serving it; sometimes bottling it, and sometimes carbonating it.</p>
      <p>We chose iced pour over instead of cold brew for a few reasons, but mainly because Iced Pour Over can be brewed fresh for our customers. As with all our beverages, we think it’s really important to only serve coffee that is freshly roasted and freshly brewed, because the flavour is better, and we’re not compromising on quality in favour of volume.</p>

        <h5>Come into any of our shops all summer long<br/>to drink an exquisite, fresh and invigorating iced pour over.<br/>
        <span>And if you want to make your own at home,<br/>here is our recipe :</span></h5>
        <div class="popup_text">
          <p class="popup_text_s">30g of coffee (ground a little finer than your filter brewing setting)</p>
          <p class="popup_text_s">200g of ice (about 6 large cubes, or 12 small ones)</p>
          <p class="popup_text_s">300g of boiling water</p>
          <p class="popup_text_s">Around 4 minutes brew time</p>
          <p class="popup_text_s">Extra ice for serving</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>1.</span>Place the ice in your serving pitcher, or whatever vessel you'll brew the coffee into. Place the filter cone on the serving pitcher, then the filter paper and the coffee in the filter cone.</li>
            <li><span>2.</span>Slowly add the boiled water to the coffee, topping up frequently. It should take about 3 minutes to add the entire 300g of boiling water, and about 4 minutes to draw down completely.</li>
            <li><span>3.</span>Once the water has filtered through the coffee, remove the filter cone and give the coffee brew a good stir. The ice should be almost completely dissolved and the coffee should be cool in temperature.</li>
            <li><span>4.</span>Then serve in a glass filled with ice and enjoy!</li>
          </ul>
