      <p class="bean_story_text">Geisha variety coffees are famous and prized worldwide for their unique and complex flavour. They tend to be supremely clean,
      citrusy and tea-like in the cup. Geisha is also a fairly rare variety, as it grows well in just a few places, and the plants are typically
      low-yielding. This makes it all the more special when we have one on offer at Market Lane!</p>
      <p class="bean_story_text">This Geisha coffee was produced by Pedro Rodriguez and his team at Agricafe – a visionary business committed to building up
      the Bolivian specialty coffee industry through education and support of farmers. To this end, Pedro has established his own farms,
      to guarantee coffee supply, trial different varieties and farming methods, and model effective farming practices. </p>
      <p class="bean_story_text">Pedro planted this special coffee at 1,650 metres above sea level - the highest point on his farm. At harvest time, the cherries
      were picked and carefully hand sorted, to ensure only the ripest, healthiest cherries would be included in the lot. The coffee was
      then processed on the same day using the washed method at the Rodriguez family’s Buena Vista Mill.</p>
