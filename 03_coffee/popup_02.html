        <h3>A cup of coffee's Coffee Club</h3>

      <h4>The Coffee Club is perfect for -</h4>
      <p>Anyone that loves to brew their own coffee at home, whether you’re just getting started or you’re a seasoned pro. A Coffee Club subscription also makes an excellent gift (it’s literally the gift that keeps on giving)!</p>
      <p>We created the Coffee Club so that our customers never run out of fresh, beautiful coffees to drink, and as a way for us to showcase the very best coffees that we source, and share them with people who will love them.</p>
      <p>Your Coffee Club parcel will be the best-smelling mail you receive all week! Our subscribers receive a different coffee every time; we share all the coffees that we have on offer in our shops, and we also source special micro-lots exclusively for our members. Along with the coffee beans, we send out a  the farm or producer, and a note from us explaining what makes the coffee special and what flavours to look for in the cup.</p>

        <h5>There are <span>two types</span> of Coffee Club subscriptions.</h5>
        <p>The first is a membership you buy for a set period of time (3, 6 or 12 months) with an option to renew at the end. The other kind of membership – our most popular – is our ongoing subscription. With this one, you will be debited with each send out. It’s just like a subscription to a magazine or streaming service, and you can cancel at any time.</p>
        <p>With both types of memberships, you tell us how much coffee you’d like to receive and whether you want your beans to arrive whole or ground for a specific brewing method. With an ongoing subscription, you can change the amount of coffee whenever you like (you might need more for Christmas or a big dinner party, for example) and with the fixed subscription, you choose the amount upfront. Both membership types are super flexible: you can pause your deliveries at any time or redirect your coffee to another mailing address.</p>
